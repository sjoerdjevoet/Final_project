    <td>iyear</td>
    <td>Numeric Variable
This field contains the year in which the incident occurred. In the case of incident(s)
occurring over an extended period, the field will record the year when the incident was
initiated.  </td>

    <td>country</td>
    <td>This field identifies the country or location where the incident occurred.</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>succes</td>
    <td>Success of a terrorist strike is defined according to the tangible effects of the attack.
Success is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the perpetrators. For example, a
bomb that exploded in a building would be counted as a success even if it did not
succeed in bringing the building down or inducing government repression.  
The definition of a successful attack depends on the type of attack. Essentially, the
key question is whether or not the attack type took place. If a case has multiple
attack types, it is successful if any of the attack types are successful, with the
exception of assassinations, which are only successful if the intended target is killed.
1 = "Yes"    The incident was successful.  
0 = "No"    The incident was not successful.</td>
